===========

(If you are looking for a piece of work to judge my coding ability, please see my "Reversi" project instead.)

My submission for the "CSUA Coding for Grub 2014" competition, Spring 2014.

The competition was to code an AI for a two player Snake-style game. The board is a hexagonal tiling contained in a rectangle, and two players attempt to claim as many spaces in the tiling as possible. Similar to Snake, a player has a "head" which at each turn can move to an adjacent space, but in this game there is no food and instead the "snake" grows at each turn, like a path being drawn out. (If I remember correctly, the players would alternate turns, but it might have been something more subtle.) If a player moves to an already claimed space (either his own or his opponent's), or if the entire board is filled, the game ends, and the player occupying the most spaces wins.

The code to my submission was run on the competition host's servers within the framework of their existing code. It can't be run on its own.
