===========

(If you are looking for a piece of work to judge my coding ability, please see my "Reversi" project instead.)

My submission for the "CSUA Coding for Grub 2014" competition, Spring 2014.

The competition was to code an AI for a two player Snake-style game. The board is a hexagonal tiling contained in a rectangle, and two players attempt to claim as many spaces in the tiling as possible. Similar to Snake, a player has a "head" which can move to an adjacent empty space, but in this game there is no food and instead the "snake" grows at each turn, like a path being drawn out. (If I remember correctly, the players would alternate turns, but there might have been something more subtle.) The game ends when one of the players gets stuck (i.e., there are no adjacent unclaimed spaces). The winner is the player who outlasted getting stuck.

The code to my submission was run on the competition host's servers within the framework of their existing code. It can't be run on its own.
